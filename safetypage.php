<h3><u>Safe transactions:</u></h3>
<p>
CAMPUS TV local ads is a service, where we recommend personal collection of the<br> 
item! Meet the seller, see what you want to buy and then pay.<br>
Don't you want to take advantage of the possibility of directly receiving the <br>
item. Remember that you do so at your own risk - CAMPUS TV does not offer you any security.<br>
While trading locally, use your common sense and have limited trust. You can also read our tips:<br>
<b>Payment</b><br>
Always meet the seller in person and transfer cash only when you are<br>
sure that the product is in conformity with the description placed in the 
announcement. Never transfer money in advance and do not pay by account! 
<br><b>Place</b><br>
Always meet in a public place (such as a shopping mall or main center). 
We do not know the person you are meeting, so be careful.<br>
<b>Subject</b><br>
The meeting allows accurate verification of item being purchased - so use 
this opportunity. Make sure the item is consistent with the description in the ad.<br>
<b>Personal Information</b><br>
Share only the necessary information. Just make an appointment and 
do not give anyone your name, address and other information that you do not need to arrange a meeting.<br>
<b>Contact</b><br>
We recommend correspondence to the user through CAMPUS TV. Do not write to them using private e-mails.<br>
</p>
<h3><u>CAMPUS TV role in transactions:</u> </h3>
<p>
CAMPUS TV does not mediate in transactions.<br>
Lets just posting ads. Finalisation of payment, and all other details are agreed upon only between the Buyer and Seller.<br>
